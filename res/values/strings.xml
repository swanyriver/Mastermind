And how many are the correct color but incorrect position.  A Black Pin indicates the correct color and position,  and a White Pin indicates the correct color.  If the Secret Code contains none of the colors you selected the hints will show all red Xs.</string>

        <item >This button will generate a random combination of colors for you to use as a guess.\n\nThis can be a good place to start a round or a good way to get inspiration if you are just plain stuck.\n\nIt is also just fun to watch,  Give it whirl!

        <item>Was your last guess way closer to the Secret Code than you are now?  Or have you strayed way far off the path and you want to go back to a guess you were getting better hints from?\n\nUse this button to move the Color Selector back through your previous guesses, then you can change a part of that selection and guess again.\n\nYou can’t take back your guesses, but this button will help you when wish you could!

        <item >Is the Red where the Purple is supposed to be? the Green where the Yellow is meant to go?
		If all your colors are correct but just not in the right order this is an easy way to re-arrange them.\n\nSimply hold your finger on the Color you would like to move then slide it over to where you think it belongs.  The color in that position will take its place.\n\nYou will see a preview of what the new combination of colors will look like, and when you drop the Color in its new position they will re-organize themselves\n\nOnce you have found all the colors of the Secret Combination this should be the only technique you are using.
